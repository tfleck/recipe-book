> Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit

---

> In a bowl, mix flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg

---

> In another bowl, beat on medium sugar, molasses, and shortening

---

> Fold the dry ingredients into the wet to make the dough

---

> Roll out the dough like a pie crust, cut it (to house dimensions) and re-roll it flat. It should be kind of thin, but not too thin or it will burn through in the oven.
