| 1 | egg |
| 2 tsp | baking powder |
| 2 tbsp | sugar |

> Lightly butter frying pan and set over moderate heat

> Bake cakes until they're full of bubbles on top, then flip

> Amount of milk determines thickness of cakes, start with smaller amount and add more if batter seems too thick, try to have milk at room temperature, don't over beat, lumps are ok, also, separating and folding in whites last will make cakes fluffier
