| | | |
|-|-|-|
| 100g | egg whites (~3 large eggs) |
| 140g | almond flour (~ 1 1/2 cups) |
| 90g | granulated sugar (just under 1/2 cup) |
| 130g | powdered sugar (1 cup) |
| 1/2 tsp | almond extract |
| 1/4 tsp | cream of tartar |
| 1/8 tsp | blue food coloring |
| 1/8 tsp | teal food coloring |

| 4 cups | powdered sugar |
| 3 tbsp | heavy cream (room temperature) |
| 2 tsp | vanilla extract |
| | pinch of salt |

> For the Cookies

---

> Sift the powdered sugar and almond flour into a bowl; whisk to combine. (For optimal fine texture, transfer to the bowl of a food processor and blitz. Repeat sifting and blitzing 2 more times.)

---

> Using an electric mix, blend the room temperature eggs in a clean bowl. Once they begin to foam, add the cream of tartar and then very slowly and gradually add in the granulated sugar.

---

> Mix in the food coloring and almond extract and continue to beat until very stiff peaks form.

---

> Begin folding in the 1/3 of the dry ingredients. Then carefully add in the remaining dry ingredients, folding gently.

---

> The final batter should have a thick lava-like consistency that resembles melty, sticky marshmallows. It should be able to fall into a Figure-8 without breaking. Spoon mixture into a piping bag with a 10-12 tip.

---

> Pipe circles onto a silicon mat or parchment paper.

---

> Pop any air bubbles by tapping the baking sheets down onto the counter several times. Then pop remaining bubbles that are on top with a toothpick.

---

> Allow the macarons to sit at room temperature for 40-60 minutes. You should be able to touch the edges and if the edges are sticky but not wet, you can place them in the oven. If the edges are still wet, you will need to allow them to sit a little longer.

---

> Bake at 300 degrees F for 12-15 minutes, rotating trays after 7 minutes.

---

> Allow to cool completely before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.

---

> For the Buttercream

---

> With a handheld or stand mixer, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy. Add in the powdered sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to medium-high speed and beat for a couple minutes. Add up to 1/2 cup more confectionersâ€™ sugar if frosting is too thin or another tablespoon of cream if frosting is too thick. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.

---

> Assemble the Cookies

---

> Pipe filling onto the back of half the cookie shells, form a sandwich and repeat until all the cookies are formed.

---

> You can enjoy these right away, but they're best after being in the fridge for a couple days.
